\begin{abstract}
Buildings consume a lot of energy and much of it is wasted. Many sensors and meters are instrumented to monitor and optimize the performance of buildings. 
However, sensor metadata uses inconsistent schema and naming spaces, sometimes even missing, which makes scalable, meaningful large-scale applitions in 
buildings impractical. We believe the learning of information of sensors such as type and location can be achieved through the sensor time series data. 
In this paper, as part of the goal towards sensor metadata generation and normalization at scale, we propose a general, simple yet effective feature extraction 
scheme to do sensor type classification leveraging an ensaemble learning method. Using data in a week collected from over 2000 sensor streams in two buildings, 
our approach is able to achieve more than 92\% accuracy for classification within buildings and more than 82\% accuracy for across building learning. We also 
formulate a solution to identifying potential misclassified streams, which can be used to help improve classification accuracy when the ground truth labels 
are not available.
