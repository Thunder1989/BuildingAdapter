\section{Conclusion}
We describe a general, simple yet effective transfer learning based approach to accomplish sensor type classification across buildings.
Our technique encapsulates the knowledge from labeled buildings and properly transfers it to other buildings to help the labeling.
By experimenting with over 3000 streams from three buildings on two campuses, our technique is able to automatically label more than xx\% percent of the labels in a new building with at least yy\% accuracy.
We also further demonstrated how much our solution can complement traditional labeling techinique.

Our technique can act as a tool for metadata construction for not only building sensors. 

% is before it becomes a generally viable solution to building metadata construction.
