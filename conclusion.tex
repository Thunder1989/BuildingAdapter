\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we take a first step towards scalable building analytics by
developing new techniques to automatically infer the type information in a building {\em
  without} manual labelling. 
Our techniques combine the complementary strengths of the data and the point name of a sensor 
to automatically create metadata for one building based on another building. 
By experimenting with over 2,500 streams from three buildings on two campuses, we demonstrate that 
our technique is able to automatically label more than 36\% percent of the labels in a new building with at least 85\% accuracy, and for some cases up to 81\% with more than 96\% accuracy.
As future steps, we illustrate how combining multiple buildings as the training source could further boost the performance, and how our solution can complement traditional labeling technique.
The solution is general, simple yet effective, which we believe can act as a tool for metadata construction for not only building sensors, but also in the broader context of the Internet of Things.

% is before it becomes a generally viable solution to building metadata construction.
