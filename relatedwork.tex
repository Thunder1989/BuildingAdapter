\section{Related Work}
There has been much research work on type classification in the context of audio~\cite{audio1,audio2}, music~\cite{music1,music2}, video~\cite{video1,video2}, web query~\cite{query1,query2} and human activity~\cite{activity1, activity2}.

Much work also adopts random forest to achieve classification tasks including ~\cite{RF1,RF2,RF3,cvpr}.

Tarzia~\cite{ABS} et. al and Wang~\cite{business} et. al utilize percentile-based feature for indoor localization and business ambience characertization purposes.
