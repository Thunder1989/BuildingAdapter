\subsection{Improvement on Classification Accuracy}
We could further explore how using external or domain-specific knowledge would help improve the classification accuracy. For example, if we know the sun sets around 6 PM and observe a trough in the reading of some streams, 

\subsection{Extension of Taxonamy and Class Scope}
We could extend the class scope to include more sensor types because there are more types than the most common ones included in this paper, e.g., alarm sensor, xxx. Meanwhile, we also want to build a more complicated taxonamy for some types, for instance, "setpoints", because there are setpoints for different parameters.
