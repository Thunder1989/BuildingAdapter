\section{Discussion}
There are several aspects of our work that we left out or did not have time to explore more deeply.
First we go over the expansion of \emph{type} classes and how we could increase coverage of sensor types in future work. 
We discuss how we could improve classification accuracy
by looking for data sources outside the building data sets. We also discuss why principal component analysis is an aspect that we
did not explore in depth and how the principal components can change from building to building.  Finally, we 
explain how our misclassification identifier could be used to improve classification results.

\subsection{Complementing Single Building Labeling}

\subsection{Better Features for Base Classifiers}
The learning and classification processes in our work relies only on a set of general features. However, we wish to explore how using external or domain-specific knowledge could help improve the classification accuracy. For instance, if we know the humidity in rooms will increase due to a rain forecast, then we could search for traces with increases in average in reading values as external knowledge to help identify humidity traces.
