\section{Introduction}

To incentivize the reduction of building energy consumption, the U.S. government
launched the Better Buildings Challenge to make buildings at least 20 percent
more efficient by 2020~\cite{doe2013better}. To achieve this goal, many
organizations are applying data analytics to the thousands of sensing and
control points\footnote{A sensing or control ``point'' is a sensor, a
  controller, or a software value.} in buildings to detect wasteful, incorrect,
and inefficient operations. Many promising analytical approaches have been
created that demonstrate promise for substantial energy savings~\cite{mpc, comfy}.
However, these analytic engines are \emph{tightly coupled} to the database schemata and metadata conventions in the buildings for which they were designed
and thus cannot easily be applied to different buildings where the type, location,
and relationships between sensors are represented differently. In practice, unfortunately, most
buildings use different metadata conventions depending on the type of equipment
in the building, the vendors of the equipment, and the contractors who
originally installed it. The process of {\em mapping} a new building to the
inputs of an analytics engine is currently a manual process that often involves
a technician visiting the building to visually inspect the equipment
installation. It can take days or weeks and is a key obstacle to the widespread
use of building analytics.

Several solutions have been proposed to facilitate the mapping problem.
Bhattarcharya et al~\cite{arka} use a programming language based solution,
where they derive a set of regular expressions from a handful of labeled examples
to normalize the sensor point names.
%This approach assumes a consistent format for all point names, which is not the
%case in practice, as shown in Table~\ref{table:ex}.
Schumann et al~\cite{ibm} develop a probabilistic framework to classify sensor types
based on the similarity between a building's point names and entries in a manually constructed dictionary.
%However, the performance of this method is limited by the coverage and
%diversity of entries listed in the dictionary, and the dictionary size becomes
%intractable when there exist a lot of variations of the same type, or
%conflicting definitions of a dictionary entry in different buildings.
Hong et al~\cite{cikm} formulate an active learning based approach to
iteratively acquire human labels for building point names and propagate the
acquired labels among similar points in the same building.  These approaches can
significantly reduce the time required for each new building, but they all still
require some manual mapping, one building at a time.

Additionally, the mapping problem cannot be solved simply by investing more
person hours at the problem. Even after a building is fully mapped, a new
analytics engine may be developed that requires a different kind of metadata,
e.g. which devices are on the northern side of the building, or which sensors
are affected by a given air handler unit. These and other types of metadata may even
never have been encoded in the original databases at all. Thus, as energy
models and building analytics engines become more nuanced, the mapping problem
will become increasingly important.

In this paper, we envision a technology that would enable any new building
analytics engine to quickly be applied to the 10's of millions of commercial
buildings across the globe. Doing so would enable a new market where boutique
analytics could quickly be matched with the buildings they would benefit the
most. The key to this vision is to perform all mapping operations automatically
and to remove the human from the scalability equation entirely. Any such system
would not need to perform perfect mapping; it must only do a first pass that is good
enough to flag the right buildings for a more detailed, manual mapping process.

As our contribution, we take a first step towards scalable building analytics by
developing new techniques to automatically infer the {\it sensor type} information in a building {\em
  without} manual labelling. The insight that guides our solution is that a
sensor typically has two attributes -- its recorded name (a text string) and its numerical readings generated over time. In particular, the sensor names are likely to be good
indicators of metadata structure but might not be consistent across buildings, while the sensor readings are more consistent across buildings but are likely to be poor indicators of sensor types. Our techniques combine the complementary strengths
of these two attributes to automatically recognize sensor types in one building based on another building. More specifically, our approach comprises three steps. 1) We start
with a fully labeled building and train multiple statistical classifiers based on the sensor stream data. These classifiers predict sensor types based on the raw data, e.g., readings from air temperature sensors are different and change more slowly than those generated by light or $CO_2$ sensors. 2) In an
unlabeled building, we cluster the points based on patterns in their names such as the phrases ``temp'' or ``occ''. 3) We ensemble the classifiers from the first building to label the points in the second building, and assign higher weights to classifiers whose predictions on an instance's neighborhood in the target building are more consistent with the name feature defined clusters.
%Our approach builds on and improves upon techniques from {\em transfer learning}~\cite{lwe}: it learns a model of the metadata from a labeled building and modifies that model so it can be applied to another, unlabeled building.

To evaluate our solution, we use a dataset with 7 days of data from over 2,500
sensors located in 3 commercial buildings across 2 different college
campuses. True sensor type information was created manually for all buildings. Then, we applied our
techniques on each building to automatically infer the sensor type information for the other 2
buildings. The results indicate that the proposed solution can automatically label at
least 36\% of the points with more than 85\% accuracy, and in some cases labels
up to 81\% of the points with 96\% accuracy. In contrast, training classifiers
on one building and applying them directly to another building 
achieves only 63\% label accuracy on average. Our technique does not label all
points, but those that are labeled have high label accuracy. %Thus, it will only support a fraction of analytics algorithms, depending on which sensors they process.
Before concluding, we present two techniques that are showing promise
to improve this coverage and expand support for a larger fraction of analytics
algorithms.
