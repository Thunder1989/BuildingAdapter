\section{Introduction}

To incentivize the reduction of building energy consumption, the U.S. government 
launched the Better Buildings Challenge to make buildings at least 20 percent 
more efficient by 2020~\cite{doe2013better}. To achieve this goal, many organizations 
are applying data analytics to the thousands of sensing and control points in 
buildings to detect wasteful, incorrect, and unhealthy operation.  
There have been many promising analytical approaches~\cite{} and it would be more effective to apply
the same analytics to multiple buildings as well as combine multiple analytics engines to
gain deeper insights for identifying the issues in buildings.
However, widespread deployment at scale is still a major challenge.
Analytical processes are \emph{tightly coupled} to the database schema and the metadata conventions in the buildings for which they were desgined, but the metadata about the type, location, and relationships between the sensing 
and control units is not presented consistently across different buildings.
% Such heterogeneity amongst buildings is pervasive and that diversity is reflected in the sensor stock and naming conventions used within and across different buildings.
% Analytical processes require the correspondence between different naming 
% conventions, so that points can be mapped to the inputs of these processes.
For instance, if company A wants to execute their 
control loops on a building contracted by company B, A needs to manually 
map the points between A and B's system. This process can take weeks and is proportional 
to the number of points that need to be used by the application. 
Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.
% This process is tedious, error-prone, and especially difficult to verify and maintain over time.

A sensing or control ``point'' is a sensor,
a controller, or a software value, e.g., a temperature sensor
installed in an office room. The metadata about the point indicates the physical
location, the type of sensor or controller, how the sensor or controller relates
to the mechanical systems, and other important contextual information. A portion of
the metadata is often encoded in the
``point name'' as short
text string with several concatenated abbreviations. Table~\ref{table:ex} lists 
a few point names of sensors in three different building management systems 
(Trane\footnote{\url{http://www.trane.com/}}, Siemens\footnote{\url{http://www.siemens.com/}} 
and Barrington Controls\footnote{The company is no longer in business.}). 
The point name \texttt{SODA1R300\_\_ART} is constructed as a
concatenation of the building name (\texttt{SOD}), the air handler unit
identifier (\texttt{A1}), the room number (\texttt{R300}) and the sensor type
(\texttt{ART}, area room temperature). As the name conveys, this point measures 
the temperature in a particular room; and it also indicates the control unit that 
can affect the temperature in this room. Different naming conventions -- 
generally guided by the equipment, vendor, manufacturer, 
and contractor --
are used in across buildings. As shown in the table, the notion of {\em room temperature} is encoded 
with a different abbreviation in each of the three buildings: \texttt{Temp}, \texttt{RMT} and \texttt{ART}.
Such variations across different buildings impose great difficulty on quickly deploying any software-based
solution.

Several researchers have started addressing this challenge using a variety of techniques.
Bhattarcharya et al~\cite{arka} use a programming language based solution, 
where they derive a set of regular expressions from a handful of labeled examples 
to normalize the sensor point names. 
%This approach assumes a consistent format for all point names, which is not the case in practice, as shown in Table~\ref{table:ex}. 
Schumann et al~\cite{ibm} develop a probabilistic framework to classify sensor types 
based on the similarity between a building's point names and entries in a manually constructed dictionary. 
%However, the performance of this method is limited by the coverage and diversity of entries listed in the dictionary, and the dictionary size becomes intractable when there exist a lot of variations of the same type, or conflicting definitions of a dictionary entry in different buildings.
Hong et al~\cite{cikm} formulate an active learning based approach to iteratively 
acquire human labels for building sensors and propagate pseudo labels among points.

All prior work is focused on approaches that require manual intervention by a human, which continues to be scaling bottleneck; even if the sensor data were all publicly available on the Internet, it would still take years if not decades of manual metadata normalization before a new analytics engine could be applied to the 5.6 million commercial buildings in the U.S.
In this paper, we present new techniques to automatically infer metadata in a building with {\it no} manual labelling. 
The basic idea is to learn the structure of the streams in a fully normalized building, and transfer that structure to an unnormalized building. 
Specifically, we encapsulate the information in the data from different perspectives, and apply the information to help predict on a new building, guided by the local structure in the point names.
For example, sensors typically have two attributes: names and data. The names often capture the meaning and relationships of sensors in a building, but this structure is not easily gleaned from other buildings due to their different naming conventions. 
The data contains no such structure, but is more likely to be similar across multiple buildings; the temperature in an office is often very similar, no matter in which building. 
% \subsection{Learning from Well-Labeled Buildings}
% Because the sensor types in different buildings 
% overlap considerably (e.g., all buildings have temperature sensors installed),
% we can leverage the knowledge about the labels in one building to 
% help normalize the labels in another.
% To bridge the gap between naming conventions for different buildings, we envision 
% a system that infers the metadata about sensing and control points to construct a normalized 
% common standard.
% This would allow faster deployment of analytics/control applications and enable
% building managers to more easily experiment with many different kinds 
% of analytic engines and smarter management techniques. 

Following these observations, we use transfer learning to transfer ``knowledge'' about the type-labels in one building to quickly learn the type-labels in another.
The algorithm constructs a few classifiers to learn the knowledge from labelled buildings, and apply them to another building for predictions where the decision of each classifier is weighted locally for each example.
We customize the algorithm by leveraging the information from both the data and the names of streams, and refine the weighting method for classifiers to imporve the performance for our problem.
Our solution is explicitly designed to \emph{eliminate} manual labeling throughout the normalization process.
% Fundamentally, transferring type-related ``knowledge'' is achievable because features in the actual timeseries data of streams are common across buildings, even when point names are drastically different. 
% For instance, room temperature readings in all buildings are largely in the range of 60-70 Fahrenheit degree while the point names of temperature points can vary substantially, as shown in Table~\ref{table:ex}.
We demonstrate that complementary strengths of both the names and the data can be combined to 
transfer the knowledge from one building to another, leveraging the information about the metadata that
we learn in each building to improve the model, increase coverage, and maximize performance.

In this work, we take another step towards automatic normalization of building 
sensor metadata that requires minimal human intervention. 
To our knowledge, this is the first transfer learning-based approach used in this domain.  
We focus on a key category of metadata: sensor {\it type} inference, and our techinique can automatically infer the type information for a considerable portion for a new building. We also demonstrate that the performance can be further boosted as we increase the amount of learning sources. 
The labeled subset by our technique could provide a base for other techniques as a warm start. 
For example, our technique can complement the traditional labeling technique for a single building. 
We summarizes the main contributions in this paper as forllows:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt \parskip1pt \parsep0pt
\item We propose a novel, effective, yet general transfer-learning approach by exploiting domain knowledge learnt from an existing building to help infer information in another building.
\item We empirically analyze how data and the point names of the streams can be transferred for classification across buildings.
\item We evaluate our proposed solution using real data and metadata from over 20 different sensor types and 3,000 sensors in three different commercial buildings.  Our solution can automatically label at least xx\% of the streams with more than yy\% accuracy without human intervention.
\item We further demonstrate how much our transfer learning based approach can accelerate traditional labeling technique for a single building.
