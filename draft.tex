\maketitle \begin{abstract} 
Building analytics can produce substantial energy
savings in commercial buildings by automatically detecting wasteful or incorrect
operations.  However, the process of {\em mapping} a new building's sensing and
control points to the inputs of an analytics engine is a highly manual process
and a key obstacle to the scalability of building analytics. In this paper, we
present new techniques to perform automatic mapping {\em without} any manual
intervention. Our approach builds on and improves upon techniques from {\em
transfer learning}: it learns a set of statistic classification models of the
metadata from a labeled building and adaptively integrates those models to
another, unlabeled building, even if the two buildings have very different
metadata conventions. We evaluate this approach using 7 days' data from over
2,500 sensors located in 3 commercial buildings. Results indicate that this
approach can automatically label at least 36\% of the points with more than 85\%
accuracy, while the best baseline achieves only 63\% label accuracy on average.
These techniques represent a first step towards technology that would enable any
new building analytics engine to scale quickly to the 10's of millions of
commercial buildings across the globe, without the need for manual mapping on a
per-building basis.
