\begin{abstract}
Building analytics can produce substantial energy savings in commercial
buildings by automatically detecting wasteful or incorrect operation.  However,
the process of {\em mapping} a new building to the inputs of an analytics engine
is highly manual process and a key obstacle to the scalability of building
analytics.  In this paper, we present new techniques to perform automatic
mapping without any manual intervention.  Our approach builds on and improves
upon techniques from {\em transfer learning}: it learns a model of the metadata
from a labeled building and modifies that model so it can be applied to another,
unlabeled building, even if the two buildings are very different. We evaluate
this approach using 7 days of data from over 3,000 sensors located in 3
commercial buildings. Results indicate that this approach can automatically
label at least 36\% of the points with more than 85\% accuracy, while the
baseline achieves only XX\% label accuracy on average.  These techniques
represent a first step towards technology that would enable any new building
analytics engine to scale quickly to the 10's of millions of commercial
buildings across the globe, without the need for manual mapping on a
per-building basis.
